# Academic Project Page Template

A clean, responsive template for academic project pages.

## Start using the template

To start using the template click on `Use this Template`.

The template uses html for controlling the content and css for controlling the style.
To edit the websites contents edit the `index.html` file. It contains different HTML "building blocks", use whichever ones you need and comment out the rest.


Search "TODO" in `index.html` for editable parts.

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be a dreambooth image of me.

### Development Setup

When you open the project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install the recommended extensions (or search @recommended in the Extensions view). Once installed, the code will automatically format on save, keeping your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code clean and consistent.

### Publish page using GitHub Pages
Go "Settings" > "Pages"

On Branch selection, select "none" and save, and then selet "main" and save again. (if the default selected branch is "none", just select "main" and save)

Wait a while, and you'll see the link of the published page.
